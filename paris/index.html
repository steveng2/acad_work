        <h2>A Weekend on the Seine</h2>
          <p>I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month!
           I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we
          were there!
          </p>

        <h4 id="day1">Day1</h4>
          <p>On our first day, we started by visiting <em>Montmartre</em> right away. Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower
           (check out that beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <em>la Seine.</em>

        <h4 id="day2">Day2</h4>
            <p>On our second day, we went shopping on<em> Avenue des Champs Elysees.</em> Every single person we saw was dressed in
               the height of fashion. After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to <em>Notre Dame.</em>
               We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer.
               After we finished shopping, we visited <em>le Louvre</em>
             </p>

        <h4 id="day3">Day3</h4>
            <p>The picture below is of me visiting the <em>Arc de Triomphe.</em> It's huge! We also went to <em>le Musee D'Orsay. </em>
              Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the
              museum also had many sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.
